# Topic - Titanic Casestudy

# Purpose -
 1. To study the dataset and try to extract the survival pattern.
 2. To achieve highest possible accuracy by using various machine learning classification models.

# Task Performed -
 1. Importing modules and loading the dataset.
 2. Checking the Nan values.
 3. Performing EDA and Preprocessing.
 4. Handling the Nan values.
 5. Spliting the data in train (x) and test (y) set.
 6. Encoding the categorical data.
 7. Creating the models.
 8. Performing accuracy check.
 9. Performing Hyperparameter tuning.
 10.Performing cross validation.
  
# Conclusion -
 - The average mean survival rate was 0.3838.    
 - The average mean fare of ship was approx 32Â£.
 - The age of youngest passenger on the ship was 0.42 years while the age of oldest passenger on the ship was 80 years.
 - The death rate was more than the survival rate.
 - Considering class wise survival the rate of survival of class 1 passengers was the highest.
   - From this it can be concluded that class 1 passengers were given higher priority in rescue operation.
 - Also it can be concluded that class 1 had more senior passengers as compared to other two classes , hence this might also be the reason of giving the class 1 a higher priority while rescuing.
  - Age 28-50 (class 1)
  - Age 21-36 (class 2) 
  - Age 19-31 (class 3)
 - The survival rate of female passengers was much more higher than that of male passengers.
  - From this it can also concluded that rescuing priority was Age and Gender based.
 - Among all the models the highest accuracy is achieved by using Decision Tree Classifier model i.e 86%.

# Achievement -
 - Successfully achieved the accuracy of above 84%.
